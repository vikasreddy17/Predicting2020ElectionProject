# Predicting 2020 Election Simulation
Simulation.py runs the simulation using the supporting csv files and python files. Simulation_Analysis.py runs the simulation analysis and produces a csv file with the results (results saved in simulation_results.csv). Visualizations.py uses simulation_results.csv to create a visualization (bar chart showing percent error for the predictions for each state)

# Jupyter Notebook Files
The Jupyter Notebook Files changed formatting wise after being zipped from Jupyter Notebook. Python files have been created with the proper code and formatting. The Python files that replace each Jupyter Notebook File have the same name, but with ".py" instead of "ipynb" as expected.

#Data Sources
'https://www.270towin.com/2020-polls-biden-trump/' was used to assign weights to each state during the simulation. 'http://www.electproject.org/2020g' was used to estimate voter turn out in each state. 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election?icid=election_nav' was used for the actual election results.
