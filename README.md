# Predicting 2020 Election Simulation
Simulation.py runs the simulation using the supporting csv files and python files. Simulation_Analysis.py runs the simulation analysis and produces a csv file with the results (results saved in simulation_results.csv). Visualizations.py uses simulation_results.csv to create a visualization (bar chart showing percent error for the predictions for each state)
